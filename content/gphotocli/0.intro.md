# Introduction

GPhoto streamlines the photo uploading process and helps you keep your photo library organized. Say goodbye to manual
photo uploads and hello to efficient photo management with
GPhoto.

## Key Features

- **Elimination of Duplicate Processing** - Through the use of a cache that relies on hash file-based keys, GPhoto ensures repeated processing of identical files is avoided. This
  not only saves time but also reduces storage usage.
- **Prevention of Duplicate Album Names** - GPhoto fetches album names directly from Google, comparing them to prohibit duplication. This attribute assists you in maintaining an
  organized and easily navigable photo library.
- **Automatic Refresh of Tokens** - If any error arises during the process of uploading photos, GPhoto automatically refreshes the token. This ensures a continuous and seamless
  uploading experience.
- **Secure Storage on Local level** - All information related to authentication and cache is securely stored locally, guaranteeing the preservation of your privacy and security. Be
  assured that GPhoto does not gather any user information.
