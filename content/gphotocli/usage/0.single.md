# Photos

## Upload Single File

```bash
php gphoto upload:photo ./path/to/photo.png
```

or you can use ` --album` to upload to a specific album.

```bash
php gphoto upload:photo ./path/to/MyPicture.png --album="My Album"
```

## Upload Multiple Files

To upload multiple files, you need to create a directory that contains all photos with the following structure:

```
. Pictures
├── MyPicture 1.jpg
├── MyPicture 2.jpg
├── MyPicture 3.jpg
└── MyPicture 4.jpg
```

```bash
php gphoto upload:photo ./path/to/Pictures
```

or you can use ` --album` to upload to a specific album.

```bash
php gphoto upload:photo ./path/to/Pictures --album="My Album"
```
