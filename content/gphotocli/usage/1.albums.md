``` 

## Upload Single Album

To upload a single album, you need to create a directory that contains all photos with the following structure:

```
. MyAlbum
├── MyPicture 1.jpg
├── MyPicture 2.jpg
├── MyPicture 3.jpg
├── MyPicture 4.jpg
└── MyPicture 5.jpg
```

```bash
php gphoto upload:album ./path/to/MyAlbum
```

This will upload all files in the `MyAlbum` directory to Google Photos and create an album with the `MyAlbum` name.

## Upload Multiple Albums

To upload multiple albums, you need to create a directory that contains all albums with the following structure:

```
. MyAlbumCollection
├── MyAlbum 1
│   ├── MyPicture 1.jpg
│   ├── MyPicture 2.jpg
│   ├── MyPicture 3.jpg
│   └── MyPicture 4.jpg
│
└── MyAlbum 2
    ├── MyPicture 1.jpg
    ├── MyPicture 2.jpg
    ├── MyPicture 3.jpg
    └── MyPicture 4.jpg
```

```bash
php gphoto upload:album ./path/to/MyAlbumCollection --multiple
```

This will upload all files in the `MyAlbumCollection` directory to Google Photos and create an album with `MyAlbum 1`
and `MyAlbum 2` names.
