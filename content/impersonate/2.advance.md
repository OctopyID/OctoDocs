# Advanced Usage

## Impersonating Manually

Sometimes you need Impersonating manually, to perform it, you can use the impersonate singleton.

```php
app('impersonate')->take($admin, $customer);
```

Or you just simply call the impersonation method directly through the User Model.

```php
$admin->impersonate($customer);
```

## Defining Guard

Sometimes, you want to use custom guards for authentication, instead of the built-in guards.

There are two ways to define Guard.

### On The Fly

```php
$impersonate->guard('foo')->impersonate($admin, $customer);
```

### Globally

You can use Guard for all Impersonation actions by registering the guard with the `AppServiceProvider`.

```php
public function boot() : void 
{
    $this->app->make('impersonate')->guard('foo');
}
```

## Leaving Impersonation

To leave Impersonation mode, you just need to call the `leave` method on impersonate singleton. This will return you to the original user.

```php
$impersonate->leave();
```

Or via Model directly, but you can't use guard on the fly.

```php
$admin->impersonate->leave();
```

Don't hesitate to use a guard if you need it.
