# Basic Usage

By default, you don't need to do anything, but keep in mind, Impersonation can be done by anyone if you don't define the rules of who can do impersonation or who can be
impersonated.

## Defining Limitation

To limit who can do **impersonation** or who is can be **impersonated**, add
`impersonatable(ImpersonateAuthorization $authorization)` on the Model to enforce the limitation.

The **impersonator** method is intended for who can perform the impersonation and the **impersonated** method is intended for anyone who is allowed to be imitated.

> **Warning**
>
> Not defining the ImpersonateAuthorization rules in the Model or misdefining them can lead to serious security issues.

The example below uses [Laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust/) for role management where **SUPER_ADMIN** can perform impersonation against **CUSTOMER**. Feel
free to use any other Role Management you like.

```php
use Octopy\Impersonate\Concerns\Impersonate;
use Octopy\Impersonate\ImpersonateAuthorization;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Impersonate;
    
    /**
     * @param  ImpersonateAuthorization $authorization
     * @return void
     */
    public function impersonatable(ImpersonateAuthorization $authorization) : void
    {
        $authorization->impersonator(function (User $user) {
            return $user->hasRole('SUPER_ADMIN');
        });

        $authorization->impersonated(function (User $user) {
            return $user->hasRole('CUSTOMER');
        });
    }
}
```
